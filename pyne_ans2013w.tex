\section{Enhanced Capabilities}

\subsection{Material Handling}

Improvements to material handling have been added to the \texttt{pyne.material}
and \texttt{pyne.mcnp} modules. A new attribute was added to the
\texttt{pyne.material.Material} class in order to store material metadata (e.g.
material name, the source of the material definition, comments).
\texttt{Material} class methods were added to write material definitions in MCNP
and ALARA \cite{wilson_alara:_1999} input file formats.  These materials
definitions are prepended by comments containing the aforementioned metadata. 

In addition, a function was added to \texttt{pyne.mcnp} to read MCNP input files and
create \texttt{Material} objects for each material specified in the file. This
function can parse formatted comments in MCNP input files in order to
populate the metadata fields of each \texttt{Material} object.

Finally, a new class, \texttt{pyne.material.MultiMaterial}, was added.  This
class stores collections of materials with along with corresponding mass or
volume fraction.  Class methods allow for mixing of these collections by mass
or volume fraction in order to create \texttt{ Material} objects.


\subsection{MCNP Support}

Two classes have been added to the \texttt{pyne.mcnp} module in order to store
MCNP data on Mesh Oriented datABase (MOAB) meshes \cite{tautges_moab:_2004}.
Storing data on MOAB meshes has numerous benefits including access to preexisting
mesh and data manipulation capabilities and easy visualization options. These
meshes are created using PyTAPS \cite{pytaps}, the Python interface to MOAB.

The \texttt{pyne.mcnp.Wwinp} class stores all of the information contained in a
single Cartesian MCNP WWINP file which contains a set of weight window lower
bounds for neutrons, photons, or both. The weight window lower bounds are
stored on a structured MOAB mesh attribute. In addition to class methods that
read-in and write-out MCNP WWINP files, \texttt{Wwinp} objects can be created
directly from MOAB meshes tagged with weight window lower bounds. This will
facilitate the future implementation of weight window generation schemes (e.g.
MAGIC \cite{davis_comparison_2011}, CADIS \cite{haghighat_monte_2003}) within
PyNE.

The \texttt{pyne.mcnp.Meshtal} class stores all the information from a Cartesian
MCNP MESHTAL file. These files may contain multiple neutron and/or photon mesh
tallies.  Tally results and relative errors are stored on structured MOAB
meshes. A dictionary attribute allows key-value access to these meshes using
tally numbers (i.e. 4, 14, 24, ...) as keys. Other methods allow for for the
addition and subtraction of tally values for different mesh tallies.

Another addition to PyNE's MCNP capabilities is the ability to read and
process particle track (PTRAC) files. The \texttt{PTRAC} card allows MCNP
users to record complete particle histories for selected events. However,
the custom binary file format used to save the particle tracks is cumbersome
to work with and varies in details, depending on system architecture or
how MCNP was compiled. The available plaintext format for particle
tracks is unfeasible due to the large size of the generated files and the
poor speed associated with processing plaintext files. Therefore, only
binary PTRAC files are supported by PyNE at this moment.

The \texttt{pyne.mcnp.PtracReader} class takes care of all the details
involved in reading particle track files and offers a simple interface
for reading event information and metadata associated with the run.
It also has a built-in function to write the particle tracks directly
to a file in the well-known HDF5 format \cite{hdf5}.

\subsection{ENDF Reader Support}

A significant improvement to the PyNE toolkit has been the developement of 
a fully fledged ENDF \cite{mclane2001endf} reader.  This parser is capable 
of handling all ENDF files and evaluations. The perfomrance of the reader is 
extrodinarily fast due to a number of inovative optimizations that.

At the top-most level a \texttt{Library} class is defined in the \texttt{pyne.endf}
module.  This module is itself written in the Cython language \cite{behnel2010cython}.
The Cython interpreter itself acts as a code-generation and optimization pass where
Python code becomes non-idomatic C/C++.  Furthermore this reader implements a
`lazy' strategy whereby data sets are only loaded into memory upon request rather 
than upon initialization.  This enables evaluations in a single physical file to be 
read independently.  This is a huge usability boon to interactive exploration of 
cross section data and decsreases application start up times.

However, the most ubiquitous speed up is in terms of converting the string
data values in the file to machine floats.  The data values stored in ENDF 
are not in an encoding compliant with
most modern programming languages float literals. Thus the built-in tools do not 
handle ENDF-type floats out natively.  However, the ENDF format does have a couple
of advantages.  It elides the `e' separator between the exponent and mantissa and
relies on the `+' and `-' characters.  This reduces the overall storage size.
Furthermore, the string literal is a fixed 11 characters long. The first character
is always a `+' or `-' or space.  The third character is always the floating point.
There are only two exponent characters and all other characters are digits.  
For example, \texttt{``-3.28559+12"}.

The predictability of this format allows for several optimizations.  A na\"{i}ve 
implementation would simply add the missing exponent `e' character to create
a standards compliant float string and calling the \texttt{atof()} function.  
However, this does not levarage the known width of ENDF or the known position of
the non-digit characters.  Hence a C++ function named \texttt{endftod()} was 
created which takes advantage of this \emph{a priori} knowledge.  Table \ref{endftod}
shows the average comparative runtimes. The custom method is nearly 
five times faster on the most-called routine when parsing ENDF files.

\begin{table}
\caption{ENDF Float Conversion Comparison}
\label{endftod}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[htbp]{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Implementation} & \textbf{Average Run Time [ns]} & \textbf{Speed Up} \\
\hline
Na\"{i}ve Python, \texttt{float()} & 539 & 1.0 \\
\hline
Na\"{i}ve C, \texttt{atof()} & 229 & 2.3 \\
\hline
PyNE, \texttt{endftod()} & 114 & 4.7 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

As an example of the ENDF readee usage, the following code in Listing \ref{endfapi} 
displays the top-level interface required to load a data set.  Figure \ref{u235} 
following this displays the data garnered in this way.  This reader has also
been exposed as a cross section data source available in \texttt{pyne.xs} 
sub-package.
